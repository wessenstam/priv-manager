Installing Licenses
-------------------

Before any agents can be connected to privilege manager, valid licenses need to be added. Delinea license Client (Windows 10 etc. / MacOS). Your trainer will provide you trial licenses for use during the training. 

.. note::

    As we are currently using Privilege Manager in a stand-alone deployment, licenses will directly be added and managed within Privilege Manager. When Privilege Manager is integrated with Secret Server, licenses can be managed for both solutions within Secret Server which provides a centralizes license management mechanism.
